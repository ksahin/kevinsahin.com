## Who am I

Hello, World, 

This is my first post on this blog. 

My name is Kevin. I'm a 26 years old software developer, entrepreneur, and book author. I live in a beautiful city called [Toulouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse), in the south of France. It's been 10 months since I left my corporate job to focus on my projects. 
In the last 10 months, here is what I did:

- Launched the landing page for my next project: [PricingBot](https://www.pricingbot.co)
- [Shoptolist.com](https://www.shoptolist.com) with my partner [Pierre De Wulf](https://medium.com/@pierreda)
- Wrote a [book](https://www.javawebscrapinghandbook.com) about web scraping with Java and sold it 70 times ! 
- I made some small freelancing gigs
- Wrote some blog posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.kevin)
- I learned how to record screencasts and made a [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/_XSEgco1lVU)
- Lost 50 pounds & hit the gym 3 times a week.

## Why this blog

I made this blog for lots of different reasons. First, I love blogging. It allows me to structure my thoughts, my experiences, and get feedback. I love to receive an email from someone telling me he learned something from one of my posts. Then, I feel like when I talk about my projects with friends/family, I'm accountable, and need to finish the project. Until not so long ago, I had many projects "in my head", I didn't talk about these projects, and ultimately, I didn't even start them. 

Blogging is also a excellent way to keep track of your own progress. It's like a time machine for your own brain, you can look at posts you wrote years ago, see how you evolved, etc.



## My goals for the next 12 months

Here are my goals for the next 12 months:

- Write a blog post 2 times per month minimum
- Launch [PricingBot](https://www.pricingbot.co) and make it ["ramen-profitable"](http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html)
- Improve my front-end skills, maybe learning a front-end framework like React or VueJS.
- Improve my marketing/growth hacking skills.
- Make some bonus video screencasts for my book.
- Read 12 books
- Improve my work routine and be more productive.
- Keep going to the gym.
- Stop using so many bullet points.
