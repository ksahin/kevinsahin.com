This blog runs on Hugo. 

Hugo is a great piece of software, it's insanely fast, has a great documentation, and a great ecosystem.

By great ecosystem I mean that there are plenty of[ open-source theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/) available, an official forum where people a friendly and ready to help. 

One thing that I don't really like about static site generators is that *I find that editing markdown files in my code editor is a bit sad.* ðŸ˜ž

I also like the fact of having some sort of content management system, where I can visually see the different drafts I have. 

I've been looking at the headless CMS landscape for a long time but I never took the time to actually test one.

I look at the ecosystem, and several CMS seems interesting to me:

* [strapi.io ](https://github.com/strapi/strapi)which is open-source
* [Netlify-cms](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms) which is open source and can be hosted directly on Netlify cloud for free
* [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) looks really nice but is commercial 

Since I already new about Netlify and the Github repository has a lot of activity, I decided to try their CMS.
